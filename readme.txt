Requirements
Python 3
pygame, numpy

INSTALLLING
cd to the directory where reFighter is installed, and run "pip install pygame numpy"
To run, cd to the installed directory and run 'python main.py'
I have not tested the installation, nor any features on OSes other than Windows 7 64 bit.

The game has unfinsihed support for different scaling modes. To view different scales, edit the "scale" variable in main.py
